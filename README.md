# Awakening-of-Azathoth
# Project Overview

## Client View of Data Structures

In this project, they start by focusing on how to use different fundamental types of data structures such as lists, maps, and sets. The goal is to become familiar with these data structures from a user's perspective.

## Awakening of Azathoth

### Game Description

In the game "Awakening of Azathoth," players have a limited number of attempts to guess a hidden word by suggesting letters one at a time. If a guessed letter is correct, all instances of that letter in the word are revealed. If the guess is incorrect, the player loses one of their attempts without any letters being revealed. The game is won if the player reveals the entire word before running out of guesses, keeping Azathoth asleep. If the guesses run out before the word is revealed, Azathoth awakens and the game is lost.

### Playing the Game

You can try playing the game through this [browser-based implementation](link). Play it a few times to understand the mechanics. You can also turn up the volume for sound effects.

### Project Tasks

1. **Create Three Different "Guessers"**:
    - Develop three AI players that can play the game by making guesses.

2. **Build Two Different "Choosers"**:
    - Implement classes that select the word to be guessed. Although this might seem simple, there is a clever twist (thanks to Keith Schwarz) that makes it an exciting data structures challenge.

### Learning Outcomes

By the end of this project, you will:
- Be able to play "Awakening of Azathoth" using your AI implementations.
- Gain experience working with Java’s built-in List and Map data structures.

**Note**: You may recognize this game as a version of Hangman. We've rebranded it to "Awakening of Azathoth" for a fresh perspective and added an interesting twist to the challenge.

# Goal 
My initial goal was to learn as much as I can for the project—nothing more, nothing less. Having knowledge of lists, maps, and sets from various Python projects made the transition to doing it in Java not so cumbersome and hard, but it still required some effort.
